# Project-Kapu$ta

PROJECT “KAPU$TA”

As a Script and a tester, I participated in a QA project
"Kapu$ta" using agile SCRUM methodology with a weekly
sprint period. 


OUR MAIN GOAL;

Comprehensive testing of
the “Kapu$ta” application, which is for tracking monthly
income and expenses divided into specific categories. The goal was to test and give opinion if the app is ready to be launched in its current state. 


MY TASK;

I focused mainly on functional testing of the application,
ensuring the comfortable use for all users
