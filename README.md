# Project-Kapu$ta

PROJECT “KAPU$TA”
As a Script and a tester, I participated in a QA project
"Kapu$ta" using agile SCRUM methodology with a weekly
sprint period. Our main goal was comprehensive testing of
the “Kapu$ta” application, which is for tracking monthly
income and expenses divided into specific categories.
I focused mainly on functional testing of the application,
ensuring the comfortable use for all users
