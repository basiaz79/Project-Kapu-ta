# <h2>Project-"Kapu$ta"</h2>

<li>The Kapu$ta project was to test the app used to track monthly income and expenses divided into specific categories. 

# <h2>Main Goal</h2>

<li>Our goal was to test comprehensively the app and based on our observations and end results, to give opinion whether the app is ready to be launched in its current state. 

# <h2>My Task</h2>

As a Script and a tester, I participated in a QA project "Kapu$ta" using agile SCRUM methodology with a weekly sprint period.</br> 
As part of my duties as a Script I was responsible for making a list daily describing various tasks each team member was to be responsible for and overall summary of the day's works.</br> 
In addition, as a tester, I focused mainly on functional testing of the application, ensuring the comfortable use for all types of users.  We have conducted functional tests, portability tests on mobile devices, and usability tests for different types of recipients.</br>
Due to frequent, daily meeetings on google meet where we discussed our progress on the tests, we were together, as a team, able to improve the product. This experience allowed me to develop project management skills and gain valuable experience in software testing.</br>


# <h2>Soft Skills used:</h2>

As a Script, <i><b>organizational skills</i></b> were helpful, as I was responsible for various tasks. Making a list daily describing various tasks each team member was to be responsible for and overall summary of the day's works.</br>
I have formed various tasks on Trello board and distributed different tasks to team members. The Trello board was helpful in monitoring the testers' work progress and completion time.</br>
My position as a script played a crucial role in ensuring the quality and reliability of a software product, and discussing them in daily team meetings helped ensure that testing efforts align with project goals and priorities. Here <i><b>precision and attention to detail</i></b> played a key role in ensuring the accuracy in each task.</br>
<i><b>Communication</i></b> was a key part of my role and I used Slack to communicate with other team members.</br>
My <i><b>empathy</i></b> for others showed respect and willingness to help other team members complete their tasks when needed.</br>
<i><b>Listening skills</i></b> were important to focus what others were saying and asking questions but also not interrupting when others spoke.</br>
<i><b>Time management skills</i></b> were crucial in successfully managing one's own time and the time of others.</br>
