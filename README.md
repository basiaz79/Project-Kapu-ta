# Project-Kapu$ta

My interest in software testing comes from my conviction that it is important to test in order to create high-quality products and from my strengths, such as the ability to analyze and problem solving, attention to detail, and communication skills. 
I am motivated by the prospect of discovering new technologies, methodologies, and testing techniques to sharpen my skills. Expanding my knowledge base and working with a team of like minded individuals where ideas are shared, challenges are tackled collectively, and successes are celebrated together.
