# <h2>Project-Kapu$ta</h2>

<li>The Kapu$ta project was to test the app used to track monthly income and expenses divided into specific categories. 

# <h2>Our Main Goal</h2>

<li>Comprehensive testing of
the “Kapu$ta” application. The goal was to give opinion if the app is ready to be launched in its current state. 

# <h2>My Task</h2>

<li>As a Script and a tester, I participated in a QA project
"Kapu$ta" using agile SCRUM methodology with a weekly
sprint period. 
<li>As part of my duties as a Script I was responsible for making a list daily describing various tasks each team member was to be responsible for and overall summary of the day's works. 
In addition, as a tester, I focused mainly on functional testing of the application, ensuring the comfortable use for all types of users. 
  
We have also done daily meetings on google meet, close cooperation and continuous improvement, we were able to effectively deliver and improve the product. This experience allowed me to develop project management skills and gain valuable experience in software testing.
