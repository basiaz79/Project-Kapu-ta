# Project-Kapu$ta

PROJECT “KAPU$TA”

The Kapu$ta project was to test the app used to track monthly income and expenses divided into specific categories. 

OUR MAIN GOAL

Comprehensive testing of
the “Kapu$ta” application. The goal was to give opinion if the app is ready to be launched in its current state. 

MY TASK

As a Script and a tester, I participated in a QA project
"Kapu$ta" using agile SCRUM methodology with a weekly
sprint period. 
I focused mainly on functional testing of the application,
ensuring the comfortable use for all users
